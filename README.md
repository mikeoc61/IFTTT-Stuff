## Various IFTTT python programs

These programs were created to investigate integration of the AWS IoT Button and
the IFTTT cloud service popularly used for home automation projects.

AWS_Button_Sim - Imitates an AWS Button Press Event

AWS_IoT_Lambda - Processes an actual AWS Button Press

Call-IFTTT - Very similar to AWS_Button_Sim

LIFX.py - Specifically called IFTTT to invoke LIFX specific Webhooks

## AWS IoT Button

Copied from: https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/

The AWS IoT Button is a programmable button based on the Amazon Dash Button hardware.
This simple Wi-Fi device is easy to configure and designed for developers to get started
with AWS IoT, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, and many other Amazon Web Services
without writing device-specific code.

You can code the button's logic in the cloud to configure button clicks to count or track
items, call or alert someone, start or stop something, order services, or even provide
feedback. For example, you can click the button to unlock or start a car, open your garage
door, call a cab, call your spouse or a customer service representative, track the use of
common household chores, medications or products, or remotely control your home appliances.

The button can be used as a remote control for Netflix, a switch for your Philips Hue light
bulb, a check-in/check-out device for Airbnb guests, or a way to order your favorite pizza
for delivery. You can integrate it with third-party APIs like Twitter, Facebook, Twilio,
Slack or even your own company's applications. Connect it to things we havenâ€™t even thought
of yet. We can't wait to see what you will build with the AWS IoT Button!
